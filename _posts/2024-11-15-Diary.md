# Dear Diary 1 

As a better way to group up these random thoughts I went with categories and tags set to Diary. As I work on the Splash Screen I realize the application that the author of the video provided seems to work much too slowly. And I can see from the generated array that it could possibly be stored more efficiently by only having pixel updates etc. So in the interest of completing one project and moving to the next and now that I am getting a little sleepy. I will head to bed enjoy a comedy podcast (possibly rewatch some of Matans guest appearances) and get some rest before the gym tomorrow.
