# Minimizing Performance Related health anxiety

I just thought I would share what over the past 2 or 3 days has helped me overcome my sleep anxiety. Taking naps when I feel like (when not obligated with immediate commitments that is) seems to be remedy for my chronic sleep deprevation when I try to adhere to an all or nothing approach during a fixed sleeeping window. That's the cool thing about the autoregulation mechanisms of the body. If you deprive yourself of sleep enough, it'll take it back somehow. In my decsision/motivation to maximize productivity and performance, I believe sticking to this approach will benefit me greatly as getting work done when I can't sleep and then falling asleep faster with the work induced fatigue is a better approach than having my anxiety keep me awake and then as a result reduce my performance in the gym. Sleep is what the body needs and the body will take it when needed. You dont have to force-feed it. Enjoy it.
