# Bar Speed Tracker Inception

Since I've received the M5 Stick as shared with my previous blog post I decided to try and get a small splash screen going on it to increase motivation.
I'm also taking this approach where I blog it kinda like a diary as I progress with it. Would love to have more time to do more work and share more consolidated updates.
However with my schedule it doesn't really make sense as of now.

I have chosen to start of with this guys tutorial:

He has a custom made tool to convert the jpegs of the gif into a header file. It's currently in the process of generating and is rather slow so I am considering this 
as an opportunity to perhaps make a faster tool. (So many ideas, yet no time. Let me add this to my mental list haha)
